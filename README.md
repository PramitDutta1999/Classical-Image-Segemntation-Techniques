# Classical Image Segemntation Techniques

This repository contains a group assignment submitted for **ENGG*6302: Image Processing** at the University of Guelph. The project focuses on classical segmentation techniques in image processing.

## Key Components

- **Region Growing Segmentation**
  - Implements intensity-based region expansion from seed points
  - Tests different thresholds and seed locations
  - Evaluates sensitivity to initial seed selection

- **Mean Shift Segmentation**
  - Applies both custom implementation and `sklearn.cluster.MeanShift`
  - Demonstrates convergence behavior and trajectory visualization
  - Estimates modes and histograms before and after segmentation

## Repository Contents

- `W25_ENGG6302_Assign2_01_mean_shift_v1_codes.ipynb`: First version of custom mean shift with step-by-step convergence
- `W25_ENGG6302_Assign2_01_mean_shift_v2_codes.ipynb`: Enhanced version using `scikit-learn`â€™s built-in MeanShift clustering
